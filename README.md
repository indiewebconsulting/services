#### How IWC Was Formed
Jonathan has spent a great deal of time interviewing several key local PNW hardware manufacturers and Software companies way up north (70 minute commute) in Seattle. However, his taste for the good life of multiple ergonomic workstations located around his house made it difficult to land some of those larger gigs. 

He says, "I'll bother you at your desk for 70 minutes after your work day if you make me drive to Seattle more than once a month."

From [Alaska Airlines](http://www.alaskaairlines.com), to [Xfinity](http://www.xfinity) and (beyond?), the IWC was birthed from a failure on Jonathan's part to land a full time gig after venturing out from the global NGO he worked for as a Web Developer for a decade. So, for three years he waited, until it was time for this cloud farmer from the City of Destiny to reveal his plans for a massive community! 

There's a dream and a desire here to be backed by developer-led free-to-all, no-subscription, pay-for-what-you-use innovations, for Small to Medium Business, in the form of the new wave of IOT. The Open Hybrid Small Business Cloud has arrived! (#PR #LULZ)

When not envying others in the #FOSS community (NOT the #FOXNEWS community), Jonathan enjoys watching 3D movies on his 80 inch projector, playing the retro-i-est of retro roms, and producing Podcasts for local Tacoma, WA voice talent, on the cheap!
