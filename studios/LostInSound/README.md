## Digital Advertising

Jen has a decade-long track record of Web software design, development and management in an NGO Digital Marketing team.  She knows how to script the correct values into your Digital properties in order to correctly track your user interactions.

As a veteran of "The Almighty Ask", Jen can provide you with simple but effective ways to incorporate your business into Search Engine tools, banner ads and scheduled Social Media posts.

## Software Development and Mentorships

With over 15 years of professional, release-managed code, Jen can provide you with direct counsel on your JavaScript 2016+ code, Object Oriented Design principles, PHP Commercial and Content sites, and more.

Even if all you need is an isolated space for your crunch-time hackathons, or have an earnest desire to learn how to code but don't know who to talk to or where to start, Jen has observed and instructed several full-time developers in incorporating exceptional code into several running, maintainable environments.

## Podcast Recording and Production

Jen has provided Voice Over talent for several small Pacific Northwest campaigns. She has engineered and provided original music for Shocked & Applaud (a women-owned film review Podcast), her original Science Fiction novel, "The Return: The Prophet", and assisted a United States military service member with an audio training CD for flying helicopters. 

Whether you have an interest in simply elevating your own voice into your Social Posts every week or require a narrator for your next publication, Jen can provide you with several options, including her own talent, to enable and uplift your message above your competitors.

## Smart Home Media Studio

With both Ethernet and 5Ghz WiFi over a 1GB up/down connection, the LostInSound studio is equipped with every facility necessary to broadcast live to your own followers.

Want to rehearse that presentation with Jen before Monday's "make it or break it" deal? We'll hook you up with a massive projector and lapel microphone to make it feel as real as it needs to be, either alone or with Jen's full nondisclosure that you needed just a bit of help to land the hand that feeds your family.

Then, take your recording home on physical media or uploaded to the Cloud. The options in-studio are nearly endless!

## Overnight Sanctuary

With approval from a local authority's release, LostInSound is equipped to help minorities, DREAMers, and those seeking asylum, who are temporarily without housing.

In addition to providing sanctuary for small or dispersed families, indiewebconsulting.com is a fierce loyalist to those who provide security for battered and domestically abused women.  As long as we can provide a maintainable schedule, women (and nongendered, as they describe themselves) who are involved in these hostile interactions with a spouse or partner have one free night's stay in the LostInSound guest bedroom. Up to two children may also stay the night for $75.

Due to the expansive nature of our studio, we can only provide one night's stay in these cases. Jen is a huge supporter of getting you the services you need to feel safe. If this is your journey, she'll help you find the next signpost to guide you further into protection for you and your loved ones.

## Live Weddings and Informal Ceremonies

Jen is an authorized wedding officiant for the state of Washington, and can assist you in memorializing your union, alone or in the digital presence of others on an Internet Television stream.

Beginning in the spring of 2020, Jen will also be providing LostInSound's PA system along with the property's backyard, to allow for a greater number of guests than what we can provide virtually this year.

As a Worship leader in a nondenominational church in Federal Way for over a decade, Jen can provide you with either DJ or live acoustic music. Have a friend who does photography, video or sound already? Let's collaborate! For a little bit extra, we can get your digital media streaming for all in a matter of hours.

Difficulty escaping for your same-sex marital vows to be completed? Rent our honeymoon suite with projector and DVD player, on 420-friendly home property. We just suggest "chilling" on that whole "vows fulfilled" thing until you can find a motel. 

We're off the Portland Ave I5 Exit, about 25 minutes southbound from SeaTac airport -- conveniently located close to the Tacoma Dome and Tacoma's Business District -- a great place to escape!

## Per-Hour Recreational Room

Just want to sit down with some comfort food, do some laundry, and let a few of your children watch a 3D movie on our projector? Moms get an automatic 10% discount (must be a valid legal guardian).

Jen is also an avid cook of international cuisine, including Latin and Japanese foods. If you bring the ingredients, who knows what might boil over? 

The studio also has several outlets for charging mobile devices, a backyard sans-dogs, video games, a 4K television with Netflix (other services soon), on-hand BluRay, DVD, and CDs, and an art table with plenty of supplies to keep young children at bay.

There are several digital, electric and acoustic instruments to keep teenagers actively rehearsing. Bring along your instructor; maybe Jen can Jam with y'all!

## Per-Night Guest Bedroom

Along with providing sanctuary services, the LostInSound basement Guest Bedroom is an established, simply decorated room available to rent by the night.

Included in your stay is access to our studio off-hours, coffee time with Jen (conversation, not consulting), a large in-room television with an Xbox 360 and local channels, a comfy futon with memory foam pillow, and a digital security camera looking out to the property's front, just in case you wanted to help us all feel a bit more secure.

Starting at $100 per night, it's a great excuse to simply get away and get work done. Your manager may have you working remotely more often if you say it's a studio with 1Gbps Internet!

## Per-Night Honeymoon Suite

Starting at $150 per night, the upstairs honeymoon suite has a Queen-sized oak bed, climate control, and a projector with a selection of DVDs to watch while spooning.

Jen is currently working on the refurbishment of this room, but it includes its own bathroom, access to the IWC stocked-by-guests fridge and full kitchen, plus amenities as needed, all included as one itemized charge on your Square-approved Credit Card.
 
## Per-Hour Medical Practice Assistance

The LostInSound studio and indiewebconsulting.com are furnished with several ways to protect its community from repeated domestic abusers. It is not always comfortable for a child to speak openly when visiting a physician's office, but this is typically the most appropriate way to document a child's journey out of abuse.

Because of this need, Jen and LostInSound provide resources that are entirely offline, and in consideration with your own knowledge of privacy and practice, can assist you in comfortably documenting your findings with your patients. With a private "BluRoom", the LostInSound studio has a refurbished bathroom with several ways to access your own files in the Cloud, locked securely in a psychologically safe environment for children. Yes, the toilet is still there, but please save it for the not-third-bathroom on the property.

## Per-Hour Educational and Arts Studio

The basement of LostInSound Studio, "Platform 9.75" is rigged with several outlets, inputs and outputs for various arts and crafts. 

Whether you are a student who needs a private place to practice, a teacher who needs an environment outside of your apartment, or a small band that has a need to lay down a few simple tracks for later, Platform 9.75 is the Tacoma equivalent of the MoPop (Museum of Pop Culture) up north in Seattle. And yet ... so much more approachable!

Due to the openness of the studio, please use your free time wisely with Jen to determine an adequate and agreeable service fee. We have residential neighbors, and Jen would really appreciate keeping her property.


## Cloud Distribution and Backup Assistance

On your way to Seattle from out-of-state and need a faster upload than a cafe or motel can provide you? Jen can provide you with per-hour service to enable you to move more quickly through the rainy, Pacific Northwest winters.

If you just need a temporary storage space for the day or want to discuss how to raise up an Intranet of your own and be the star of your organization, don't hesitate! You may not even need an appointment.

Email [Jen to schedule an appointment](info@indiewebconsulting.org) or text 206-554-9469 to reach the LostInSound property directly.

## Mobile Phone Screen Replacements 

If you have all the parts ordered (and are the CORRECT parts, ugh!), Jen will, indeed, fix this part of your computer within 24 hours or you receive an immediate discount until it is determined that it's in good working order or it's out of Jen's control. Hey, equipment is hard!

Starting at $49 for a mobile device under 7", we'll do the best we can or let you know why it's still borked when you stop by the next day.

It's not photo development in an hour, but hey, it's your phone. So that's nice.

## Equipment Rentals

No, you can't borrow the PA system ... without a signature and a lot of collateral. But, we do have a lot of smaller options such as a 1080p Canon HD camera with HDMI out, USB DVD burners, older generation devices for software testing, and a lot more. 

See something in the studio that you'd like to borrow? It's probably cheaper just to use it here! Especially if you know what you're doing and don't require Jen's assistance. 

## Small Business Counseling 

Although currently in its first year, indiewebconsulting.com is the second brand owned by Jen, and one of several brands that she has professionally maintained in the Media and Entertainment industries for over 15 years.

The LostInSound studio was initially the property address of Bistorm, LLC, a registered company with Washington state for a year.

Jen has described herself as the "Female Steve Jobs", and enjoys entertaining those in her chosen Media professions. If you have a small or locally owned business, and are struggling to communicate your brand online, she may have some helpful hints and directions to assist you.

In addition to maintaining Web properties, indiewebconsulting.com can also provide you with options to establish your identity using your own logins and credentials, secured as you need, as long as it meets industry standard measures for protection.

Why not text the LostInSound studio at 206-554-9469 to schedule an appointment or [e-mail Jen](info@indiewebconsulting.com) to schedule an appointment?
